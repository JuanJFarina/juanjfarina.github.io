I was born in Rosario, Argentina, on July 27th, 1990. From a young age, I have been passionate about video games and computers, as well as sports and the arts.

During my youth, I participated in soccer, basketball, tae-kwon-do, and tennis, and I also enjoyed drawing.

At 18, I started dancing hip-hop, which led me to explore nearly every dance form and eventually become a professional dancer, teacher, and director.

At the same age, I began studying Computer Science and coding my first apps. After two years, I decided to pursue a career in dance, leaving my computer science studies behind.

However, I continued coding apps and participating in hackathons and video game development groups, although I did not pursue a developer job at that time.

During my 20s, my passion for anime grew. I had watched Japanese anime since I was young but started to prefer that medium over others.

In 2018, I took an entry exam for Mensa. I had known about the organization for a few years but had not had the chance to take an exam in my city. I wanted to determine if my perceived difference from others was real or just a personality trait. I was accepted into Mensa, proving an IQ higher than 98% of the population. This was a reassuring experience that boosted my confidence and allowed me to meet some of the most amazing people.

Two years later, I created my own ballet school, Academia Rosario Ballet, which has been growing ever since. I began writing books and articles about ballet and teaching online teacher training courses to people worldwide.

In January 2023, I decided to return to coding. I took courses and certifications, worked on projects alone and in groups, and started looking for a job. I also returned to university to complete my computer science degree. Nearly six months after starting my job search, I received three job offers simultaneously.

I chose to become an MLOps Engineer at PwC, as it seemed the most challenging and interesting for my future. I already knew some of the people working there, and my future manager was one of my Mensa friendsâ€”someone I knew would be a great mentor.

Today, I am enjoying my work as an MLOps Engineer while also studying and growing as a developer. I am working on my own projects and looking forward to the future.

What am I looking forward to in the future? Becoming an even better engineer, traveling around the world, and learning new cultures and languages.
