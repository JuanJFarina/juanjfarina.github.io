I'm a Junior MLOps Engineer from Argentina, currently working at a big company. My expertise includes Azure DevOps, Azure Pipelines, Databricks, MLFlow, and programming languages like Python, YAML, TOML, Powershell, and Bash. Having a background in Web Development, I've worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Java, and SQL. I'm also passionate about anime, RPG videogames, and I've been a ballet teacher and dancer for over 10 years.
